We're tired of dealing with short battery life on laptops, so we created a new battery using bleeding-edge solid-state technology to double capacity, increase longevity, and make charging extremely fast.

# How it works

Currently, most laptop batteries use lithium-ion. Lithium-ion batteries work by storing charges in lithium atoms. As a lithium-ion battery discharges, these electrons leave the lithium atoms, "ionizing" them. These lithium ions move through a separator within the battery and recombine with electrons to recharge.

However, lithium-ion batteries have multiple drawbacks. As lithium-ion batteries experience use, "dendrites" form, increasing heat and decreasing battery life. Lithium-ion batteries can also swell up, imposing a serious hazard to both the device and the user. (Source F)

CeramaPower batteries use a different technology based on ceramics.
