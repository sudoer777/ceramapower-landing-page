We're tired of dealing with short battery life on laptops, so we created a battery using bleeding-edge solid-state technology to double capacity, increase longevity, and make charging extremely fast.

# How it works

Currently, most laptops use lithium-ion batteries. Lithium-ion batteries work by storing charges in lithium atoms. As a lithium-ion battery discharges, these electrons leave the lithium atoms, "ionizing" them. These lithium ions move in a liquid solution through a separator within the battery and recombine with electrons to recharge.[^1]

However, lithium-ion batteries have multiple drawbacks. After numerous charge cycles, "dendrites" form on the separator, increasing heat and decreasing battery life. Lithium-ion batteries can also swell up, imposing a serious hazard to both the device and the user.[^2]

CeramaPower batteries use a different technology based on ceramics. Unlike lithium-ion batteries, CeramaPower uses a solid material as the electrolyte.[^3] Because no liquid is used, CeramaPower batteries are much less likely to combust than lithium-ion batteries, even when cut open. CeramaPower batteries are also built to prevent dendrite formation. Because of these features, CeramaPower batteries can safely withstand much higher temperatures and charging rates without significant degradation.[^4] Additionally, solid state batteries like CeramaPower have shown to last twice as long as lithium-ion batteries on a single charge.[^5]

# Our purpose

As new battery technologies are being developed for products such as electric vehicles, we thought: Why not use them in laptops as well?

In a survey we conducted on Facebook with 49 participants, we found that 51% of our participants had issues with laptop battery life. Of these participants, the majority on average did not use their laptops unplugged for greater than two hours at a time. The rest, except for one, did not use their laptops unplugged for greater than four hours at a time.

Based on this information, it was clear that the laptop battery needed to be improved. Because of this, we created CeramaPower. With CeramaPower, we see a future where laptop users can focus on the important parts of life for several hours at a time without worrying about running out of battery.
